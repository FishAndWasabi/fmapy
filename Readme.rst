==================================
 (BETA) Free Music Archive Player
==================================

(NOT) THANKS to http://freemusicarchive.org/ for the music!

Why NOT?

When I started this project FMA had an API to search and browse the
archive. This client used this API. They desided to shut it down
without warning or asking users. So NOT THANKS anymore. :(

Run
===

You need Python3.

Install the requirements and run.
::

   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   $ python fmap.py

Usage
::

   Choose a genre and it will start downloading all songs for it

Ideas/Todos
===========

- IDEA: write a player again. to be able forward and skip songs at least
- IDEA: Have different browsers(genre[ ], curator[ ], search[X])
